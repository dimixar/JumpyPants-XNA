JumpyPants-XNA
==============
It was written using C# and XNA framework on Visual Studio 2010.

Source code for a game I made.

It's a simple arcade game where you need to control a stick man to evade some obstacles.

This was my first serious project. The formatting of the code is pretty bad and I don't recommend you to read the comments
if you don't know romanian language, and even if you know romanian language I still don't recommend to read 
those comments,because most of them are describing obvious things that are understood from the names of variables and methods. And I'm too lazy to reformat it properly.


If you found something useful for your problem, go ahead, copy it, use it, modify it, I don't really care.
